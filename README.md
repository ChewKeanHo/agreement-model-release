A published baseline model release agreement in various formats for quickly
release a model from a media content (example: person/pet in an image or video).




## Business Reasons

This project was initiated for 3 reasons:

1. Most model release forms are tied to entities - it's rare to find a public
   usable version; AND
2. Too much drama when a media is used for commercial project; AND
3. Most agreements are not that clear about its terms with fancy languages.




## Version Controlled

This agreement is version controlled using
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) definitions where:

1. the `MAJOR` version denotes major legal changes; AND
2. the `MINOR` version denotes minor changes without altering the legal
   implication side of things such as but not limited to grammar correction,
   fonts, typo, and etc; AND
3. the `PATCH` version denotes the repository management changes such as but
   not limited to new language addition, updating `README.md`, and etc.

By default, the agreement is always using the latest and greatest. If you want
a specific version, download that agreement file and include it into your
product repository.
