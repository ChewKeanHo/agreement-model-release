A published baseline model release agreement for quick release a model from a
multimedia content (e.g. person or pet in an image or a video). This version is
setting both the owner and releaser agreed on a zero cost and with the sole
purpose of releasing no additional terms.

This is a continuous research project's bi-product usable to anyone and everyone
for both personal and commercial uses.




## Why It Is Required

The project was initiated mainly for:

1. Most legal documents are too specific (e.g. applied to software but not
   images and vice versa) making a lot of product-based project inheriting
   mulitple licenses; AND
2. Some legal documents communities are too dramatic for queries; AND
3. Most legal documents are written in legal-specific languages only lawyer can
   understand rather than written in simple native language comprehensible by
   everyone; AND
4. A lot of legal documents cannot be iteratively improved with respect to time
   and market conditions.




## Version Controlled

This legal document is version controlled using
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) defined as follows:

1. **MAJOR number** - denotes major non-backward compatible changes; AND
2. **MINOR number** - denotes major backward compatible changes including
   without limited to grammar corrections, fonts, typo, and etc; AND
3. **PATCH number** - denotes minor backward comaptible changes including
   without limited to updating repository `README.md`, changes of publication
   system, and etc.

By default, this document is designed to **ALWAYS USE THE LATEST AND GREATEST**.
For any project repository, you only need to include the notice as its legal
document into your repository (e.g. as `LICENSE.txt`).

If your project repository requires only a specific version,
**THEN YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD THAT VERSION FULL DOCUMENT AND INCLUDE THE NOTICE**
(e.g. as `LICENSE.txt`).




## Compliances

This document is written for comply with:

1. **[US Plain Language Goverment Guideline](https://plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/)** -
   making legal friendly to any general public without assistances.




## Supported Languages

Currently, this document is written for the following languages:

1. International English (`en`)
2. 国际简单华语 (`zh-hans`)




## Credits

These are the official stewards:

1. **[(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho](https://chewkeanho.com)** - principal author and
   reviewer.

These are the folks who indirectly improve this license upto a considerable
quality either by resources sharing or scanning:

1. **[Bruce Payne](https://perens.com/)** - for relentlessly providing license
   drafting guidances and emotional positivity.




## Artificial Intelligence (A.I) Decrees

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

This project deploys the use of one or more generative artificial intelligence
such as but not limited to large language model (LLM) for the following tasks:



### Data Sourcing

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing enhanced web searches due to polluted search engine indexes.
> * Performing completely generated media such as but not limited to images,
>   videos, and audios.

* Used for data and reading material searching as the search engine across the
  Internet had collapsed due to A.I publication slops.
* Used for grammar and language correction detection on the human-made written
  script.



### Data Processing & Analytics

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing development via multi-steps queries (also known as
>   *vibe coding* or *agentic AI processing*).
> * Performing data analytics via multi-steps queries (also known as
>   *vibe coding* or *AI vibing*).
> * Performing dedicated and task specific work where conventional technologies
>   could not achieve such as but not limited to upscaling an image verbatim.

No deployment.



### Data Testing

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing end-user use case simulated testings.

No deployment.



### Data Visualization

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing completely generated data visualization via multi-step queries
>   (also known as *vibe coding*).

No deployment.



### Data Archiving & Deletion

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing data clean-up via multi-step queries (also known as
>   *vibe coding*).

No deployment.
